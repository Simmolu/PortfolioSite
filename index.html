        <p>I am a Graduated Mechanical Engineer that got interesting in programming my senior year of school. I had always spent a lot of my life 
            on computers growing up but never really took any chances with trying to learn the code behind all of the programs I used every day.

            The interest however, was always there. And my Senior year of school I took an online Python coding course and was hooked. Now I am on
            a path to become a proficent software designer and developer, and hope to work as a software engineer for my future career. I am trying
            to do as many projects as I can in as many langauges as I can to get as much exposure to the world of software development. This website
            serves as my personal portfolio of my projects, and was also coded personally by me.

            <h3 class="project-title">Project 1: Pomodoro App <div class="caret"></div></h3>
            <p class="project-description" style="display: none;">This was my first real "app" that I developed and built to an executable, using Python. The app is essentially a recreation of a 
                "pomodoro timer" which is a study technique I made use of often during my Engineering degree. 
                
                The app has a start and reset button,
                the "start" button will start a pomodoro set, which consists of 4 blocks of "focus time" and "rest". The focus blocks are 25 minutes
                long and the rest is 10 minutes. After each set is completed a green checkmark will be added above the buttons. If the reset button 
                is clicked at any time during the set it will go back to 00:00 and remove all checkmarks. \n
                  
                This app required my understanding of:
                    1. Tk - I had to develop the User Interface for the app with the Tkinter library
                    2.

            <h3 class="project-title">Project 2: Snake Game <div class="caret"></div></h3>
            <p class="project-description" style="display: none;">Everyone makes a Snake Game at some point during their learning journey, and I chose to make mine in Java.  I ended up using 
                the Turtle library which utlizies StdDraw for drawing to the screen. The game uses an event system which monitors the typical game 
                movement keys WSAD to move the head of the snake around the screen. If the player touches either side of the screen or their own tail 
                the game ends. There is high score saving capability as well which will add the current score to a text file if it is higher than the 
                stored value.
