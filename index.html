        <p>I am a Graduated Mechanical Engineer that got interested in programming my senior year of school. I took an online Python coding course and was hooked. Now I am on
            a path to become a proficent software designer and developer, and hope to work as a software engineer for my future career. I am trying
            to do as many projects in as many languages as I can to get a lot of exposure to the world of software development. This website
            serves as my personal portfolio of my projects, and was also programmed by me.

            <p class="project-description" style="display: none;">This was my first real "app" that I developed and built to an executable, using Python. The app is essentially a recreation of a 
                "pomodoro timer" which is a study technique I made use of often during my Engineering degree. 
                
                The app has a start and reset button,
                the "start" button will start a pomodoro set, which consists of 4 blocks of "focus time" and "rest". The focus blocks are 25 minutes
                long and the rest is 10 minutes. After each set is completed a green checkmark will be added above the buttons. If the reset button 
                is clicked at any time during the set it will go back to 00:00 and remove all checkmarks.<br><br>

            <p class="project-description" style="display: none;">Everyone makes a Snake Game at some point during their learning journey, and I chose to make mine in Java.  I ended up using 
                the Turtle library which utlizies StdDraw for drawing to the screen. The game uses an event system which monitors the typical game 
                movement keys WSAD to move the head of the snake around the screen. If the player touches either side of the screen or their own tail 
                the game ends. There is high score saving capability as well which will add the current score to a text file if it is higher than the 
                stored value.

            <p class="project-description" style="display: none;"> 
                I wrote a dynamic banking application simulator using Python with a Tkinter GUI. The project models functionalities seen in real-world banking software, offering a hands-on approach to understanding core principles in software design and database management. Key Highlights:<br><br>
                <strong>Interface Design:</strong> Built a user-friendly GUI with Tkinter that guides users through options such as account creation, user login, balance check, deposit, and withdrawal.<br>
                <strong>Integration:</strong> Utilized SQLite3 to maintain a local database that securely stored user information, including usernames, passwords, account balances, and account creation dates. Implemented CRUD operations for account management. <br>
                <strong>Authenitcation:</strong> Incorporated a secure login system which allows a user to access their account details, and an admin system to oversee all accounts and manipulate the database. <br>
                <strong>Operations:</strong> Facilitated basic banking operations such as deposits and withdrawals, updating the balance in real-time and reflecting these changes in the database. <br>
                <strong>Functions:</strong> Enabled special privileges for an administrator to view all accounts, delete specific accounts, and even wipe the entire database, showcasing the multi-level user role capabilities of the application. <br>
                <strong>Handling & Validation:</strong> Implemented error handling and validation checks, ensuring correct user input and displaying appropriate feedback messages for situations like invalid login attempts or insufficient account balance. <br>

            <p class="project-description" style="display: none;"> 
                I wrote a program in C++ for simulating the orbits of satellites at varying altitudes around the Earth in 2D.<br><br>
                <strong>Interface Design:</strong> Built a GUI 2 dimensional representation of orbiting satellites with the SFML library<br>
                <strong>Simulation:</strong> Leveraging the orbital period of the satellites based on altitude, the simulation can accurately display the future position of the satellite at any time after the simulation starts based on its starting altitude from the Earth's surface.<br>
                <strong>Library Usage:</strong> Using the powerful 2D graphics library SFML, I was able to draw the Earth, the orbiting satellites, and any on screen clickable text. The satellites can even be clicked and blown up to show more information!<br>
                <strong>Framerate:</strong> This GUI has a dynamic framerate: In order to avoid the satellites "skipping" around the screen at higher simulation time multipliers, the framerate automatically adjusts to smooth the visual of the satellite's orbit. <br>
                <strong>Language Usage:</strong> I was able to take full advantage of the Class structure in C++ to allow for easier integration of the SpaceObject and Simulation structures in the program.<br>

            <h3 class="project-title">Project 5: Raycaster Engine <div class="caret"></div></h3>
            <p class="project-description" style="display: none;"> 
                I wrote a raycasting video game engine in C++ utilizing the SFML graphics library.<br><br>
                <strong>Interface Design:</strong> On screen display of minimap, player position, and angle that rays are calculated at.<br>
                <strong>Simulation:</strong> The engine is a realtime rendering of the minimap seen from the players perspective. It seems like you're really standing in a 3 dimensional room! The simulation also checks the player position whenever you try to move, and will stop you if you try to walk through any walls. <br>
                <strong>Library Usage:</strong> Using the powerful 2D graphics library SFML, I was able to draw the minimap, floor, sky, and all rays which represent the walls being looked at by the player.<br>
                <strong>Psuedo 3D</strong> Raycasting technically doesn't produce 3 dimensional graphics, but it looks close! Using trigonometry, the engine constanly calculates the distance from the player camera to the walls being looked at, and varies the height of the rays drawn on screen depending on this distance. The end result is what seems like 3D walls being drawn. <br>
                <strong>Language Usage:</strong> I was able to take full advantage of the Class structure in C++ to allow for compartmentalization of my program. There is a class for handling the Camera, the Minimap, and the overall application loop.<br>
